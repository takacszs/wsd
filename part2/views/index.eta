<h1>Story time!</h1>
<form method='POST' action='/'>
    Name: <input type='text' name='name' /><br/>
    Emotion: <input type='text' name='emotion' /><br/>

</form>
<p>
    Waking up, <%= it.name %> felt <%= it.emotion %>. <%= it.name %> had spent most of the previous evening with friends, and recalled that they were writing an application. <%= it.name %> had an inkling that the application had something to do with brainwaves, but simply could not recall what. The feeling, being <%= it.emotion %>, must have had something to do with the application.
